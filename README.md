# .NET Unchained

This project is a modern web development framework, it uses .NET core for the backend and Angular 1 for the frontend. This project comes out of the box with an admin panel and some very cool plugins, both for frontend and backend.
On the backend we have got:
    Swagger (For debugging REST APIs)
    Entity framework SQL-SERVER (ORM)
    .NET Dependence Injection (Keeps code clean and mean!)

On the frontend we have:
    Angular 1 (Yep!)
    angular-datatables
    ui.router
    angular-jquery-locationpicker (The most awesome location picker widget)
    ngMap (google maps)
    flatpickr (An awesome date/time picker)
    chosen-ajaxified (A drop down manager that uses ajax for querying data as the user types)
